# BookFace
A bare-bones social media network created using Django, JavaScript, Jinja, Bootstrap, and HTML

Users can create posts, edit their posts, delete posts, like posts, follow other users, view a curated page of posts from the followers, and more.

The liking, following, editing, and deletion features were implemented through JavaScript's fetch API by sending PUT, DELETE, and GET requests to my Django web server.

The site also includes pagination made avaiable by Django's paginator.
