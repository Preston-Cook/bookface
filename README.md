# BookFace
An MVP of a social media network using Django to handle web requests, JavaScript's fetch API to asynchronously query a SQLite database with custom API routes, and Jinja to dynamically change HTML content. The aesthetics of the site were achieved with Bootstrap 5

The site also includes pagination made avaiable by Django's paginator.
